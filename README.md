<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

>Welcome to the Todo List project! This project is a simple web application that allows you to create and manage your daily tasks. Here's how you can get started:

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

>In order to run this project you need:

Node.js: Webpack is built on top of Node.js, so you will need to have it installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

NPM: NPM is the package manager for Node.js, and it is used to install and manage the dependencies of your project. It is included with Node.js, so if you have installed Node.js, you should have NPM installed as well.

### Setup

>Clone this repository to your desired folder:


git clone https://github.com/kayjeee/webpack-todolist.git


### Install

>Stylelint
Run
npm install --save-dev stylelint@13.x stylelint-scss@3.x stylelint-config-standard@21.x stylelint-csstree-validator@1.x

>ESLint
Run
npm install --save-dev eslint@7.x eslint-config-airbnb-base@14.x eslint-plugin-import@2.x babel-eslint@10.x

### Usage

>To run the application, use the following command:

>npm start
This command will start a local development server and open the application in your default browser.

### Run tests

>Stylelint
npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"

>ESLint
npx eslint .
### Deployment

>You can deploy this project using:Github pages

To use GitHub Pages, you will need to create a new branch called gh-pages in your repository and push your website files to this branch. Then, in your repository settings, you can enable GitHub Pages and select the gh-pages branch as the source.

Another option for deployment is to use GitHub Actions. This allows you to automate your deployment process by creating workflows that run on certain triggers, such as a push to a specific branch or a new release. With GitHub Actions, you can use pre-built actions or create your own custom actions to build, test, and deploy your project.

If your project requires more complex deployment strategies, such as containerization or serverless deployment, you can use third-party services such as Docker, AWS, or Heroku. These services integrate with GitHub and allow you to deploy your project directly from your repository.

Regardless of the deployment strategy you choose, it's important to ensure that your deployment process is secure and reliable. Make sure to follow best practices such as using encrypted secrets for sensitive information and testing your deployment process thoroughly before releasing to production.
